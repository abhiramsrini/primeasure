## Project Overview

Primeasure Technologies Website is a static site representing a distributor specializing in Test & Measurement and Broadcasting Solutions in India. The site showcases featured products, trusted partners, and company information, targeting clients in electronics, broadcasting, and related industries.

## Key Guidelines

- **HTML Structure:** Use semantic HTML5 elements for clarity and accessibility.
- **Styling:** All styles are managed in `css/style.css` and `css/responsive.css`. Maintain responsive design for all new pages.
- **JavaScript:** Place scripts in `js/main.js`. Keep scripts modular and avoid inline JavaScript in HTML.
- **Assets:** Store images in the `images/` directory, organized by type (e.g., `products`, `partners`, `customers`).
- **Pages:** Place additional pages in the `pages/` directory. Use subfolders for logical grouping (e.g., `pages/solutions/`).
- **Navigation:** Update the navigation bar in all relevant HTML files when adding new pages.
- **Accessibility:** Use alt attributes for all images and ensure keyboard navigation works.
- **Performance:** Optimize images for web and minimize CSS/JS where possible.
