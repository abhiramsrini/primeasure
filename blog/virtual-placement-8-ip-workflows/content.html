    <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Virtual ads and augmented graphics now ride on IP-first production chains. Chyron’s Virtual Placement 8.0 adds native SMPTE 2110 ingest/output and tighter camera tracking, removing SDI-only constraints and helping broadcasters monetize courtside inventory faster.</p>

    <h2>What’s new in Virtual Placement 8.0</h2>
    <ul class="article-checklist">
      <li><strong>2110 end-to-end:</strong> Uncompressed IP ingest/output lets graphics stay in the ST 2110 domain without SDI roundtrips, aligning with modern REMI/centralized control rooms.</li>
      <li><strong>Hardware-free court tracking:</strong> Computer-vision tracking for basketball removes physical sensors, shrinking setup time and on-site kit.</li>
      <li><strong>Expanded sport layouts:</strong> Prebuilt court templates speed calibration and ad placement for multiple basketball venues.</li>
      <li><strong>Lower-latency preview:</strong> Faster scene render/preview improves operator confidence during live tosses.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Primeasure POV for India broadcasters</h2>
    <p>Networks shifting to 2110 in India (sports and news) can slot Virtual Placement 8.0 into existing IP cores without SDI gateways. For OBs still hybrid, the same toolset preserves SDI compatibility via the production switcher. The hardware-free tracking is a win for tight basketball schedules—fewer rig points, quicker approvals from venue ops, and reduced freight.</p>

    <h2>Recommended workflow</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Bring 2110 camera feeds into Virtual Placement 8.0; keep PTP clock alignment consistent with your production network.</li>
      <li>Use the basketball templates to lock calibration; validate with a short pan/tilt path and sideline replay.</li>
      <li>Publish clean/dirty outputs over 2110 for your vision mixer; reserve one multiviewer tile for operator preview.</li>
      <li>For monetization, prebuild sponsor looks (baseline, center-court, benches) and map them to MOS/automation cues.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Implementation checklist</h2>
    <ul class="article-checklist">
      <li>Confirm ST 2110 support on your backbone (bandwidth, NMOS control, PTP).</li>
      <li>Stage a latency test: capture glass-to-glass with and without AR to prove timing before match day.</li>
      <li>Document a fallback scene (minimal graphics) to cover tracking dropouts.</li>
      <li>Align ad ops with legal on virtual inventory zones for each venue.</li>
    </ul>
