    <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> I3C blends high-speed data with tight timing rules. PurVue embeds a real-time oscilloscope inside the analyzer workflow so engineers can see protocol and PHY behavior together—cutting debug cycles for sensors, MCU hubs, and mobile designs.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>1) Embedded real-time oscilloscope</h2>
    <p>PurVue captures analog waveforms alongside protocol events. You can spot overshoot, ringing, or marginal rise times right where arbitration or HDR commands occur.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>2) Protocol + PHY correlation</h2>
    <p>Markers align decoded I3C traffic with eye views, letting you tie NACKs or timing violations directly to signal integrity issues instead of guessing.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3) Deep buffering for bursts</h2>
    <p>Extended memory keeps long captures intact—useful for multi-sensor bursts, hot-join sequences, or vendor-specific command flows.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>4) Flexible triggering</h2>
    <p>Trigger on protocol conditions (e.g., HDR enter/exit, hot-join) and on analog thresholds to catch rare glitches that only show under certain load states.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>5) Automation hooks</h2>
    <p>Script captures and pass/fail checks to integrate I3C validation into CI pipelines. Reuse test lists across firmware drops to block regressions.</p>

    <h2>Primeasure POV</h2>
    <ul class="article-checklist">
      <li>Correlate PurVue captures with scope-based eye/jitter on critical nets (SDA/SCL) to confirm margins before board release.</li>
      <li>Baseline hot-join timing across temperature corners; log analog markers with decoded events for reproducibility.</li>
      <li>Add automated alarms for SDA/SCL rise/fall limits so marginal boards are flagged early.</li>
    </ul>
