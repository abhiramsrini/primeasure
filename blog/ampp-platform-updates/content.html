                    <h2>Primeasure’s Recommendations</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Review marketplace offerings.</strong> Identify templates that match your existing workflows—sports playout, news clipping, or pop-up channels—and pilot them with actual content.</li>
                        <li><strong>Plan connectivity.</strong> Ensure backbone connectivity and VPN security are ready before adding remote nodes to AMPP.</li>
                        <li><strong>Update runbooks.</strong> Document how AMPP interacts with legacy on-premises devices so operators can manage both worlds smoothly.</li>
                        <li><strong>Engage vendors early.</strong> Coordinate with graphics, replay, and audio partners to confirm AMPP integration roadmaps before going live.</li>
                    </ol>
