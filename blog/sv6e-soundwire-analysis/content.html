    <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> SoundWire links sit between digital controllers and audio codecs in phones, wearables, and PCs. Timing, skew, and protocol edge cases can derail bring-up; the Introspect SV6E shortens that learning curve with fast stimulus/capture at the physical layer.</p>

    <h2>1) Flexible PHY stimulus and capture</h2>
    <p>The SV6E can both generate and capture SoundWire traffic with fine control over line states. That lets engineers reproduce start-up sequences, clock-stop/clock-start scenarios, and low-power entry/exit without swapping hardware fixtures.</p>

    <h2>2) Automation-ready scripting</h2>
    <p>Python-based automation wraps register writes, waveform edits, and pass/fail checks into reusable scripts. Teams can batch-run skew sweeps, bus-reset tests, and error-injection cases to find margins instead of hunting intermittent failures manually.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3) Rapid compliance-style checks</h2>
    <p>Built-in measurements (duty cycle, jitter, eye views) align with SoundWire timing budgets. Engineers can flag violations early—before committing boards or firmware—by comparing captured traces against spec thresholds and logging results automatically.</p>

    <h2>Primeasure POV</h2>
    <ul class="article-checklist">
      <li>Use the SV6E as a virtual golden device during early firmware drops—script power-state transitions and verify wake latencies.</li>
      <li>Pair SV6E captures with oscilloscope eye/jitter views (e.g., Teledyne LeCroy) to correlate protocol errors with signal integrity.</li>
      <li>Add these scripts to CI for audio SoCs to block regressions when PLL or clock-tree changes land.</li>
    </ul>
