                    <h2>Why Cloud Production Now?</h2>
                    <p>Grass Valley recently explored whether cloud-native production is the breakthrough sports broadcasters have been waiting for. Their article, <a href="https://www.grassvalley.com/is-cloud-production-the-game-changer-sports-broadcasting-has-been-waiting-for/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Is Cloud Production the Game-Changer Sports Broadcasting Has Been Waiting For?”</a> outlines both the promise and the practical hurdles. Primeasure supports Indian broadcasters making the same transition, so we distilled the highlights and added local context.</p>

                    <h2>Readiness Checklist for Indian Broadcasters</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Assess connectivity.</strong> Ensure reliable low-latency links from stadiums to your preferred cloud region, with secondary paths for backup.</li>
                        <li><strong>Plan security and compliance.</strong> Align with data residency and sports league requirements before sending contribution feeds to the cloud.</li>
                        <li><strong>Integrate legacy systems.</strong> Decide which routing, graphics, and replay tools will stay on-premises and how they’ll interoperate with cloud services.</li>
                        <li><strong>Invest in training.</strong> Grass Valley notes the need for cultural change—operators must be comfortable mixing, switching, and monitoring from software interfaces.</li>

                    <h3>Primeasure Perspective</h3>
                    <p>We recommend starting with marquee events or secondary channels to build confidence. Hybrid deployments—where contribution is cloud-based but distribution stays on-prem—help mitigate risk while preparing teams for full adoption.</p>
