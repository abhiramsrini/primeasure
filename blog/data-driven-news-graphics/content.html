    <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Live news graphics must be fast, accurate, and brand-consistent. Chyron PRIME’s data bindings, automation hooks, and newsroom integration reduce manual edits so producers can push verified visuals on-air in seconds.</p>

    <h2>Unified data pipelines</h2>
    <p>PRIME pulls structured data (election results, finance feeds, sports stats) directly into templates. Fields stay bound to sources, cutting copy/paste errors and keeping lower thirds synchronized as numbers update.</p>

    <h2>NRCS and MOS-friendly</h2>
    <p>MOS-driven playlists let newsroom teams trigger graphics from within their rundown tools. Producers stay in the NRCS; graphics operators get consistent payloads without last-minute retyping.</p>

    <h2>Automation and macros</h2>
    <p>Reusable macros handle repetitive tasks—like updating tickers, side panels, and fullscreens when a data source refreshes. Fewer touchpoints mean fewer on-air mistakes during breaking news.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>Brand control at speed</h2>
    <p>Centralized style rules keep typography, color, and motion consistent across lower thirds, tickers, maps, and explainer cards. Designers lock the look; producers just pick the variant and data source.</p>

    <h2>Primeasure POV</h2>
    <ul class="article-checklist">
      <li>Wire PRIME templates to election/APIs and finance feeds once; expose only safe fields to producers.</li>
      <li>Add QA checks: require source + timestamp fields to display in operator UI before take.</li>
      <li>Use macros for “breaking” states that flip animations and colorways without rebuilding graphics.</li>
      <li>Document a rollback path to static slates if a feed drops mid-show.</li>
    </ul>
