                    <h2>Why Scope Network Hygiene Matters</h2>
                    <p>Teledyne LeCroy’s article, <a href="https://blog.teledynelecroy.com/2022/05/four-essential-oscilloscope-network.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Four Essential Oscilloscope Network Security Practices,”</a> explains how connected scopes can be entry points if they are left unpatched or unmanaged. Primeasure fields similar questions across R&amp;D labs in India, so we summarised the guidance and added our own guardrails.</p>

                    <h2>Four Essential Practices</h2>
                    <ul class="article-checklist">
                        <li><strong>Align with IT security policy.</strong> Treat oscilloscopes as endpoints on the corporate LAN; document who can remote in, and restrict services to what IT approves.</li>
                        <li><strong>Patch OS and application software.</strong> Keep Windows updates and oscilloscope application releases current to close known vulnerabilities and improve stability.</li>
                        <li><strong>Install trusted antivirus.</strong> Run an IT-approved AV agent on scopes used for remote file transfers or automation, and validate that performance impact is acceptable.</li>
                        <li><strong>Run scans and update definitions.</strong> Schedule periodic scans and keep virus signatures fresh so new malware is caught even on lightly used lab instruments.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Primeasure Lab Checklist</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Segment test gear.</strong> Place scopes on a lab VLAN with firewall rules limiting inbound ports to remote UI/control tools your team actually uses.</li>
                        <li><strong>Standardise images.</strong> Build a known-good Golden Image per scope family (e.g., WaveSurfer 3000z, WaveMaster) with approved patches and AV, then clone to keep fleets consistent.</li>
                        <li><strong>Automate upkeep.</strong> Use Windows Update rings and AV policy to push patches and definitions during maintenance windows to avoid surprising operators mid-measurement.</li>
                        <li><strong>Document remote workflows.</strong> Write runbooks for remote operation (VNC/RDP/MAUI automation), including who can enable services and how to disable them after a session.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>Primeasure Field Insight</h3>
                    <p>Teams often enable remote access during a debug sprint and forget to lock it down afterward. Add a weekly “scope hardening” task to your lab checklist: verify services, users, and AV status before the next round of captures.</p>
