        <h2>Why PCIe 6.0 Demands a Fresh Look</h2>
        <p>Teledyne LeCroy recently highlighted the challenges of qualifying PCIe 6.0 transmitters at 64 GT/s. PAM4 encoding, new equalization schemes, and tighter voltage margins mean that the test setup you used for Gen5 must evolve. At Primeasure, we see the same concerns when supporting semiconductor customers across India. Below is our summary of the article <a href="https://blog.teledynelecroy.com/2023/02/making-new-pcie-60-transmitter.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Making the New PCIe 6.0 Transmitter Compliance Tests Simple”</a> with practical tips for local labs.</p>

        <h2>Build a Calibrated Test Chain</h2>
        <ul class="article-checklist">
            <li><strong>Use compliant fixtures:</strong> Channel loss must match PCI-SIG templates. We recommend purchasing or fabricating fixtures with S-parameter reports and verifying them with a VNA before testing.</li>
            <li><strong>Leverage SDA/TDME automation:</strong> Teledyne LeCroy’s tools streamline pre-emphasis and equalization sweeps. Automating these steps reduces manual mistakes and keeps logs consistent.</li>
            <li><strong>Run frequent calibrations:</strong> Daily TDR/TDT checks ensure the oscilloscope, cables, and filters still meet amplitude and timing tolerances.</li>
            <li><strong>Capture reference waveforms:</strong> Save the “golden” eye diagram for each DUT and fixture so you can track drift across firmware iterations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Exercise New Compliance Tests</h2>
        <p>The PCI-SIG added several transmitter tests for Gen6, including precursor/postcursor crosstalk, transmitter offset, and multi-lane skew. Primeasure recommends:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Automate preset sweeps.</strong> Use the TDME application to run all presets and capture pass/fail status. This is faster than manual knob turning and produces consistent reports.</li>
            <li><strong>Monitor BER while tuning.</strong> Combine bit-error-rate instrumentation with SDA traces to understand whether equalization changes improve both signal quality and protocol reliability.</li>
            <li><strong>Document margin analysis.</strong> Store SDA eye masks, jitter breakdowns, and compliance margins for each board. When a customer RMA arrives, you can compare results instantly.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Primeasure Field Tip</h3>
        <p>We always include a second oscilloscope channel to monitor a reference clock or power rail. Many “transmitter” failures turn out to be clock jitter or supply droop. Catching those early saves days on the debug bench.</p>
