    <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> A high-voltage probe that’s under-rated, noisy, or too capacitive can distort waveforms or destroy a scope. Teledyne LeCroy’s framework keeps measurements safe and accurate for power electronics, EV inverters, motor drives, and grid gear.</p>

    <h2>1) Match voltage rating and derating</h2>
    <p>Pick a probe whose DC and peak ratings exceed the highest expected waveform with margin. Watch the fine print: some ratings are only at 50/60 Hz. Use generous headroom for fast edges on SiC/GaN switching.</p>

    <h2>2) Choose attenuation for dynamic range</h2>
    <p>Higher attenuation (e.g., 100:1) protects the scope and widens input range but reduces sensitivity. Select the lowest ratio that keeps peaks within the probe’s linear region and the scope’s full scale.</p>

    <h2>3) Mind bandwidth and rise time</h2>
    <p>Bandwidth must cover the fastest edge rates you need to see. As a rule of thumb, probe bandwidth ≥ 5× the signal’s highest significant harmonic; otherwise overshoot and dv/dt will be misread.</p>

    <h2>4) Control capacitive loading</h2>
    <p>High-voltage probes add capacitance that can reshape switching transitions. Compare input capacitance specs and use the shortest ground return possible to reduce ringing.</p>

    <h2>5) Verify common-mode limits</h2>
    <p>For floating or half-bridge nodes, check common-mode voltage ratings and isolation category. Differential HV probes help reject common-mode noise and keep both inputs within safe limits.</p>

    <h2>Primeasure POV</h2>
    <ul class="article-checklist">
      <li>For SiC/GaN measurements, prioritize probes with low capacitance and ample bandwidth; pair with scopes that support deskew to align voltage/current waveforms.</li>
      <li>Standardize test benches with documented derating rules and probe-to-scope attenuation presets to avoid misconfiguration.</li>
      <li>Add a quick pre-test checklist (ratings, attenuation, bandwidth, CMV) to every power lab station.</li>
    </ul>
