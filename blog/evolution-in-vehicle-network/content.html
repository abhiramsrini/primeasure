                    <h2>From CAN to High-Speed Ethernet</h2>
                    <p>Teledyne LeCroy’s post <a href="https://blog.teledynelecroy.com/2023/02/the-evolution-of-in-vehicle-network.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“The Evolution of In-Vehicle Network Protocols”</a> traces how automotive networks moved from CAN/LIN to Automotive Ethernet. Primeasure works with OEMs and Tier-1s across India who face the same transition, especially as ADAS and infotainment bandwidth explode. Here’s what stood out to us.</p>

                    <h2>Legacy Buses Still Matter</h2>
                    <ul class="article-checklist">
                        <li><strong>CAN &amp; LIN remain the backbone:</strong> Body control, powertrain, and HVAC still depend on these robust protocols. We encourage customers to maintain CAN monitoring even while rolling out Ethernet backbones.</li>
                        <li><strong>Gateway complexity grows:</strong> With more domains, gateway ECUs must translate signals between CAN, LIN, FlexRay, and Ethernet. Logging tools need synchronized time-stamps to make sense of the traffic.</li>
                        <li><strong>Diagnostic coverage is critical:</strong> Use protocol analyzers to make sure software updates don’t break legacy behaviors while enabling new features.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Automotive Ethernet and Zonal Architectures</h2>
                    <p>According to Teledyne LeCroy, Automotive Ethernet is the only path to support high-resolution cameras, RADAR, and consolidated compute domains. Primeasure agrees—and adds a few recommendations:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Validate PHY and protocol layers together.</strong> Combine oscilloscopes with LeCroy’s protocol tools to capture both eye diagrams and packet behavior during stress testing.</li>
                        <li><strong>Plan for zonal architectures.</strong> Future vehicles will rely on zonal controllers linked via Ethernet, reducing wiring weight but increasing the need for robust timing analysis.</li>
                        <li><strong>Adopt secure OTA workflows.</strong> Networking and cybersecurity are intertwined; verify that Ethernet gateways enforce authentication and encryption even during development.</li>
                    </ol>
